# remove_outliers.py

This script removes all outliers from a given amino acid sequence alignment that are listed in the file `outlier_2.txt` generated by the script `checker_complete.2.pl`<sup>[1](#one)</sup>.

## System requirements

* Python 3.6.4 or newer
* Required Python modules: `Bio`, `os`, `shutil`, `sys`

## Input

1. The script has to be in the same directory as the `outlier_2.txt` file generated by `checker_complete.2.pl`<sup>[1](#one)</sup>.

2. The script expects that the amino acid alignments are found in a `aa/` directory that has to be in the same directory as the script.

## Output

If not already present, the script will create a directory `aa_outliers_removed/` that will contain all processed files.
